# PCTO Experience Portfolio Website

<br>

Welcome to the repository of my **PCTO Experience Portfolio Website**. This project showcases my journey, learnings, and projects during the **PCTO (Percorsi per le Competenze Trasversali e per l'Orientamento)** experience, also known as **Work-Based Learning** or **Internship Experience**. 

The website is designed to give an overview of the skills I’ve developed, the tasks I’ve completed, and the overall impact of the program on my education and career aspirations.
